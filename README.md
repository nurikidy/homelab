# HomeLab @nurikidy

This repo will documents my journey building my own homelab at my own home, obviously. The documentation will cover the following topics:

- setup Mikrotik Router
- setup Mikrotik Managed Switch
- LAN configuration
- Server installation using bunch of mini pcs
- Server configuration based on use cases (k8s/k3s clusters, proxmox, IoT, CI/CD, pihole etc)
- Hardening, tweak and tuning
